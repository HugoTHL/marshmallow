            1. Why is it important for young people to help communities in need?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Helping communities in need can benefit the moral development of young people. Many young people in Hong Kong focus solely on academics at the expense of other important aspects of development. When young people help others, they learn to understand different situations and diverse challenges in the community. For example, the Hong Kong Red Cross provides a platform for secondary school students to visit households living in subdivided units. During the program, young people have a chance to visit the households living in subdivided units. They will help them clean the house or buy some daily necessities, such as fruit. As a result, young people can better understand the condition of residents who live in subdivided flats. It enhances their awareness of our community and sense of responsibility, which encourages young people to participate more in volunteer work.

            2. Suggest one activity that the school can organize to help communities in need, and provide one reason for your suggestion.
        </h1>
        <p>
            The school can organise a food donation activity with the food bank. The soaring food prices in Hong Kong take a heavy toll on underprivileged families. Hong Kong is lauded as a gourmet paradise, however, there remains a marginalised group of impoverished residents in dire need of food assistance for their survival. It is intolerable to have residents go on an empty stomach in a prosperous city like Hong Kong. The food bank will collect the surplus cooked and uncooked food donated by students and teachers. Then, the food collected will be donated to the underprivileged families, alleviating their financial pressure of food expenses. The food donation activity involves the whole school, not a specific group of people. Everyone can donate the surplus food from their home. Participating in the activity awakened students' awareness of food deprivation. Also, it pushes the moral development of students, encourages them to care the community and help others. Therefore, the school can organise a food donation activity.
