            1. why some museums want to put their art collections online?
        </h1>
        <p>
            The reason for museums putting art collections online is that it can improve the accessibility of art collections. By digitalising the art collections and publishing online, everyone can access and study the art collection by anywhere and anytime. Take the Virtual Exhibition from The Palace Museum as an example, it exhibits a diverse array of Chinese Calligraphy, Blue and White Pottery and Wooden Furniture. Foreigners who want to discover and study traditional Chinese culture do not have to fly to Beijing to see it. They can experience Chinese Culture through internet. Locals can also study those art collections without queuing or after the Museum closes. The unprecedented convenience improves the accessibility of art collections and the culture propagation. Allows citizens access a wealth of art collection at their fingertips and breaking down the physical barriers.

            2. How viewing art online is different from viewing it in person?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Viewing art online is difficult to discover the details of the artworks behind the screen. At the museum, you can experience the artworks in different perspectives by stepping forward and backward in different angles. For example, when you view a Chinese Calligraphy in the person, you can observe the details of the artwork by stepping closer. Visitors can observe the thoughts and emotions conveyed by the artists through the force of different strokes or sharp curves, the artists used their ways to express. The different of lights and shadows in the museum will also affect your experience on different artworks. However, viewing an artwork online is difficult to observe these details even when you zoom in the image, as images of the artworks will be blurred when you zoom in, even when you are wearing a VR headset. Therefore, viewing an artwork in person allows you discover the details of the artworks, it will make you find more about the message behind artwork than just view the art online.
