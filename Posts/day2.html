            1. Is it important for buildings to look attractive?
        </h1>
        <p>
            It is not important for buildings to look attractive. Designing a building should accommodate the fundamental requirements of the users. Considering the need for shelter in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, houses must offer the highest level of safety to fulfil the physiologies and safety needs of humans. Japan is suffering from earthquakes and tsunamis every year. As a result, a safe housing structure is the top priority of Japanese architecture, then the appearance. Essentially, if you suffer from the building lack of safety, it will be meaningless. Therefore, it is not compelled to purse an aesthetically pleasing appearance of a building. Instead, safety should be put in the first place.

            2. What are the reasons for keeping buildings that many people consider ugly?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Ugly buildings have their historical value and sentimental value. Ugly building has their historical value and sentimental value to a community. The ugly buildings carry the collective memories of a community. The ugly buildings in a community may be an iconic signature in the development of society. Kwun Tong Jockey Club Clinic was built in the 1960s. Many residents in Kung Tong went to that clinic when they were young. The deconstructing of the clinic removes the collective memories of the Kung Tung residents. In fact, the buildings retained a vast array of posters that consist of the medical development of Kung Tong. If we remove those ugly buildings, how can we inform future generations about the past? Nowadays, the youngest are more difficult to understand the development of Kung Tong after the deconstruction of the clinic. Without understanding the past through those ugly buildings, residents lose their collective memories and sense of belonging to the community. The youngest may be difficult to understand the history.
