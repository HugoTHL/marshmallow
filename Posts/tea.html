            <p>I was captivated by the caramel aroma of the milk tea. It's no exaggeration to say that it tastes exactly like bubble tea, which I drink from Tenren or Kung Fu Tea.</p>
            <p>Before the Okinawa Brown Sugar Puer Milk Tea, there was another product called Oolong Milk Tea. I have no idea why they produced Oolong Milk Tea before. The milk tastes burnt. Leaves a lasting impression that milk tea is awful.</p>
            <p>But now, everything has gone. Everyone should try the Supreme Okinawa Brown Sugar Puer Milk Tea, a delectable drink.</p>
